# treereduce

`treereduce` is a fast, parallel, syntax-aware, multi-language program reducer
based on tree-sitter grammars. In other words, `treereduce` helps you shrink
programs while maintaining some property of interest, for example, that the
program causes a compiler crash or outputs a certain message. See [the
documentation](./doc) for more information.
